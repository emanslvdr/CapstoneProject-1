<p>Hi, I'm a college student who loves to play video games! When I'm not hitting the books or battling it out in
    a virtual
    world, you can usually find me creating art. Drawing is my specialty, and I love nothing more than capturing
    the beauty
    of the world around me through my artwork. My passion for gaming and art go hand-in-hand, and I often find
    myself
    drawing inspiration from my favorite games and characters. Whether I'm immersed in a new game or working on
    a new piece
    of art, I'm always pushing myself to improve and explore new creative avenues.</p>
<p>In addition to my love for gaming and art, I'm also passionate about web development. I find the process of
    building
    websites and applications fascinating, and I'm always looking for ways to expand my knowledge and skillset
    in
    this area.
    Whether I'm tinkering with HTML and CSS or diving into more complex coding languages, I love the challenge
    of
    building
    something from scratch and seeing it come to life online. As a college student with a wide range of
    interests,
    I'm
    excited to see where these passions take me and how I can combine them to make a positive impact on the
    world
    around me.</p>
<p>I am currently a first-year <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer
            Science</a></strong> student at <strong><a href="https://web.facebook.com/amacctarlac/?_rdc=1&_rdr">AMACC
            Tarlac</a></strong>, and I
    am
    learning <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_development">Web Development</a></strong> as of
    02/26/2023. I aspire to become a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development">Front-end
            developer</a></strong> and
    specialize in
    <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a></strong>,
